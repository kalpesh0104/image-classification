"Decsription": 

We're building a smart computer model that **looks at pictures of handwritten numbers (0–9)** and **learns to recognize them** — just like how your brain sees "5" and knows it’s a 5.We teach the model by **showing it thousands of example images**, and over time, it learns the patterns (like curves in 3, loops in 8, etc.).After training for a few minutes, the model becomes good at **guessing the correct number**, even for new images it’s never seen before — with **accuracy around 98%**.It's like teaching a kid with flashcards until they get really good at it.
